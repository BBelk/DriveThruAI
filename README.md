## Description
A few weeks ago I read an article about a certain fast food company looking into using AI to handle their drive through orders. I thought "Wow, I could actually do that". A few days later it's done. This "AI drive through experience" app will let you experiment with the future of ordering junk food. 


## Importing into Unity
Clone this git repo into an existing Unity project, then in Unity navigate to DriveThru-> then open the DriveThruAI.scene. You may need to import TextMeshPro into Unity, which you should automatically be prompted to do.

From there, click on "GameManagerObject" in the Hierarchy window (on the left). In the GameManager script in the Inspector window, input your own OpenAI Key and Organization ID, as well as your Eleven Labs API Key. You will need your own OpenAI and Eleven Labs Accounts.

## Try it out
Only available on Windows, download it and run the .exe.
